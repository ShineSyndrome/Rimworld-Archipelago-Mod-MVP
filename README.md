# Rimworld Archipelago Mod

### for connecting Rimworld to the multiworld multi-game randomizer, [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)

This repository holds the client-side code, a mod that can be installed in RimWorld. The server side archipelago code is not yet added to the [main archipelago repository](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago), and as such cannot yet be utilized on archipelago.gg, instead see [my fork](https://github.com/StephenLujan/Archipelago) of archipelago.
